<p>I am a front-end developer and beginner HTML5 game maker from Poland.</p>
<p>This site was created as a result of my eagerness to learn and to share knowledge that will inspire and teach others. I don't want this blog to be strictly technical related, but in most cases it probably will be. I am willing to improve my English and programming skills, so I am open to your comments, notes and kind critique.
</p>
<p>
I am also passionate about sci-fi movies, books, nature photography, board games and traveling.
