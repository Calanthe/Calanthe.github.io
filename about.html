<div class="about post">
<p>I am a 27 year old front-end developer and beginner HTML5 game maker living in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland. This site was created as a result of my eagerness to learn and to share knowledge that will inspire and teach others. I don't want this blog to be strictly technical related, but in most cases it probably will be. I am willing to improve my English and programming skills, so I am open to your comments, notes and kind critique.
</p>
<p>
I am also passionate about movies, books, photography, board games and traveling. My biggest dream is to visit all the national parks in the USA :).
