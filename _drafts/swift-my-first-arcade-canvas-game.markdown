![Swift - arcade game]({{ site.url }}/assets/duckhunt.jpg)  

This time I would like to show you how easly you can develop a simple arcade game in [canvas][canvas]. As a example, I will use a [Swift game][swift_game] which I made for 2012's edition of [JS13KGames][jsk13_games]. 

<!--more-->

It's important to mention, that the whole mechanics of this game is strongly inspired by [the Swift Stich game][original_swift] made by [Sophie Houlden][sophiehoulden]. I found her game very entertainment, because of the perfect combination of easy to learn rules and hard to play gameplay. I thought this will be a perfect example for me to build similar game with similar but easier and custom levels and rules. If you find my version of game too easy and want to play something more challengable? - give a try to the original [Swift Stich game demo][original_swift_demo] the real fun starts when you reach 'gravity' levels ;).
